## Overview

A light weight plug-in that adds the table editing controls from the full version of TinyMCE, optimized for WordPress. Note that this may not work in conjunction with other plug-ins that significantly alter or replace the visual editor's default behavior.

Note that the table controls are contained in the “kitchen sink” toolbar, toggled with the last button on the first row of controls.

## Support Level

**Stable:** 10up is not planning to develop any new features for this, but will still respond to bug reports and security concerns.  We welcome PRs, but any that include new features should be small and easy to integrate and should not include breaking changes. We otherwise intend to keep this tested up to the most recent version of WordPress.
